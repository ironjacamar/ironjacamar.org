## Forking the Project
To contribute, you will first need to fork the [iron-jacamar](https://github.com/ironjacamar/ironjacamar.org) repository.

This can be done by looking in the top-right corner of the repository page and clicking "Fork".

The next step is to clone your newly forked repository onto your local workspace. This can be done by going to your newly forked repository, which should be at `https://github.com/USERNAME/ironjacamar.org`.

Then, there will be a green button that says "Code". Click on that and copy the URL.

Then, in your terminal, paste the following command:
```bash
git clone [URL]
```
Be sure to replace [URL] with the URL that you copied.

Now you have the repository on your computer!
