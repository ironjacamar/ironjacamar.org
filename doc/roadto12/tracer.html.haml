%h1 The IronJacamar tracer

The Java EE Connector Architecture
%i
  ConnectionEventListener
\'s are a key part of the specification, as they are responsible for maintaining the
relationship between the
%i
  ManagedConnection
and the application handles, and their state inside the container.

%p

It is also through the
%i
  ConnectionEventListener
that the
%i
  XAResource
instance is enlisted, and delisted from the transaction - if supported - either through
%i
  LocalTransaction
or
%i
  XATransaction
\.

%p

While IronJacamar generates useful TRACE log about these interactions the amount of data can be too
much for humans to process within a reasonable time frame.

%p

The IronJacamar tracer produces machine-readable codes at a special TRACE log category at key points
during the entire interaction of the
%i
  ConnectionEventListener
making it easy to apply tooling of the data collected.

%p

An example of a code could be

%p

.code
  IJTRACER-TxLog-3-1400076333382-578a5496-
  %br

%p

which isn't very useful.

%p

However, looking at the entire interaction as a UML sequence diagram is

%p

%img{:src=>"/images/tracer.png", :alt=>"Tracer example", :width=>"100%"}

%p

included in the 
%a{:href=>"tracer-example.html"}
  HTML report
generated by the tracer-report application.

%p

The generated report is broken down into a

%p

%ul
  %li Pool
  %ul
    %li ConnectionListener
    %ul
      %li Timestamp

%p

hierarchy, with a status indication of the interaction pattern.

%p

This should make it a lot more simple to find the
%i
  ConnectionEventListener
instance that is in error, and the timestamps where the error occurred. Then the "real" TRACE log can be consulted
to look for the possible cause.

%p

The IronJacamar tracer can be enabled by setting the "org.jboss.jca.core.tracer" category to TRACE, and calling the

%p

.code
  org.jboss.jca.core.tracer.Tracer.setEnabled(true);
  %br

%p

method.

%p

We hope that you will find this feature useful when tracking down problems, and we will of course keep expanding
the functionality of the tracer and associated tools.
